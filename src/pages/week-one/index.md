## Summary
This was our first week in Lambda Labs. I have been looking forward to this for a long time and let me tell you it was nothing like I imagined. It was full of time spent researching, studying, learning, and discussing to decide how best to buid this project. No coding at all. But let me tell you this was the best decision we made. Making sure we had looked into many tech stack options an deciding which would work best for this specific project was vital. We are now equiped with a stack that will provide us the best tools and environment to build this project.

We are fortunate enough to have some really awesome and strong developers on the team. We do all work well together and are able to manage ourselves so well. I thought about who will be on my team and what will it be like and I am incredible happy with how that turned out. Strong team and a strong project, I am excited for what we will be building.
